# Introduction
## Business purpose
Business purpose –  IMAG History & Science Center is a museum located in Fort Myers, FL with the original goal of allowing people of all ages to explore and discover in the areas of physical, life, and aquatic sciences along with the rich history of Southwest Florida.  Most recently the history and science center has been transformed into an institution dedicated to learning through hands-on activities. As Imag continues to improve its processes and services, one area of concern for the History and Science center relates to its collection and retention of water chemistry documentation.  The current process for the documentation of water quality samples necessitates physical encoding of water chemistry on a paper sheet. The new proposed system calls for the creation of an online fully digital Aquarium Dashboard that will allow users of the new system to digitally upload water quality samples, recall historical data, analyze historical trends, and view graphs that can contribute to hands on learning. 
## Business scope
1. IMAG History & Science Center
2. Range of business activities: 
* Living Lab 
* USS Mohawk CGC Aquarium
* SEA-to-SEE Touch Tank
* Lionfish: Underwater Invaders Aquarium 
* Outdoor Exhibits
* Water Works
* Fisheye Lagoon 
* AQUAPONICS
3. The proposed system is to be developed as a web application that can be accessed online via phone, laptop, or apple tablet. The new water chemistry dashboard should provide operational level system support. The functional support will include but is not limited to gathering user input data, storing user input data into a database, processing user data, and producing an output in the form of a graph or chart.

# 5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system -  
## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept
### a) operational policies and constraints;
   a.	Operational constraints include which team member should have access to the Data Dashboard. Is there any sensitive user information that would need to encrypted?  Is there any higher authority that would dictate any action that restricts freedom of action? Is there a constraint on the computer hardware that the software should operate on.  Is there a constraint on the hours of operations that the data is collected. 
### b) description of the proposed system;
   a.	 The proposed preliminary concept will be to implement a new Aquatics Data Dashboard for the Imaginarium aquarium in Fort Myers, FL.  The dashboard will provide important data analytics for water chemistry in the aquariums to help provide better water quality  for live animals in the proposed aquarium.
### c) modes of system operation;
a.	The system will be built with either a web app based  system or regular  app based system.  
### d) user classes and other involved personnel;
  a.	Different users should have different access and different levels of authority within the system. 
  b.	User include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>i.	Executive Director</li>
<li>ii.	Senior Director of Operations</li>
<li>iii.	Senior Director of Development & Communications</li>
<li>iv.	Marketing Manager</li>
<li>v.	Director of Education</li>
<li>vi.	Director of Education Programs</li>
<li>vii.	Senior Keeper & Volunteer Coordinator</li>
<li>viii.	Guest Services Associate</li>
<li>ix.	Communications Coordinator</li>
<li>x.	Museum Store Supervisor</li>
<li>xi.	Educator</li>
<li>xii.	STEMLab Senior Educator</li>
<li>xiii.	STEMLab Educator</li>
<li>xiv.	Volunteer Historian</li>
<li>xv.	FabLab Manager</li>
</ul>  

### e) support environment.

# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
The initial source of stakeholder engagement will be through zoom meetings, and Microsoft forms questionnaires to elicit and form the basic functional and business requirements for the Aquatic dashboard. An agile contract will be produced with key strategies on solutions regarding  information solicitation and contracting issues. Developers and business analysts will work with key stakeholders on the design, production, and verification of the Aquatic Dashboard software. 
## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept
The preliminary deployment will be done with a Beta Test of the user software in the user’s environment to assess usability, functionality, security, and reliability of the software. 
## 6.3 Preliminary support concept
Preliminary support will be done during the Beta testing phase of the software development. Support will be provided via methods which include but is not limited to phones calls, text messages, emails, and support tickets.  Initial release of the software will include a user manual to provide training support to users. 
## 6.4 Preliminary retirement concept
Preliminary retirement of the system will involve replacing the software from production with a newer version or removal of the software completely. 
# 7. Project Constraints
Constraints with completion of the software may include government restriction with data acquisition, procedures, and policies.
