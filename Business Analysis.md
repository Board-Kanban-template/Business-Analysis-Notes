# 5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system -  
## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept
### a) operational policies and constraints;
   a.	Operational constraints include which team member should have access to the Data Dashboard. Is there any sensitive user information that would need to encrypted?  Is there any higher authority that would dictate any action that restricts freedom of action? Is there a constraint on the computer hardware that the software should operate on.  Is there a constraint on the hours of operations that the data is collected. 
### b) description of the proposed system;
   a.	 The proposed preliminary concept will be to implement a new Aquatics Data Dashboard for the Imaginarium aquarium in Fort Myers, FL.  The dashboard will provide important data analytics for water chemistry in the aquariums to help provide better water quality  for live animals in the proposed aquarium.
### c) modes of system operation;
a.	The system will be built with either a web app based  system or regular  app based system.  
### d) user classes and other involved personnel;
  a.	Different users should have different access and different levels of authority within the system. 
  b.	User include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>i.	Executive Director</li>
<li>ii.	Senior Director of Operations</li>
<li>iii.	Senior Director of Development & Communications</li>
<li>iv.	Marketing Manager</li>
<li>v.	Director of Education</li>
<li>vi.	Director of Education Programs</li>
<li>vii.	Senior Keeper & Volunteer Coordinator</li>
<li>viii.	Guest Services Associate</li>
<li>ix.	Communications Coordinator</li>
<li>x.	Museum Store Supervisor</li>
<li>xi.	Educator</li>
<li>xii.	STEMLab Senior Educator</li>
<li>xiii.	STEMLab Educator</li>
<li>xiv.	Volunteer Historian</li>
<li>xv.	FabLab Manager</li>
</ul>  

### e) support environment.

# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
The initial source of stakeholder engagement will be through zoom meetings, and Microsoft forms questionnaires to elicit and form the basic functional and business requirements for the Aquatic dashboard. An agile contract will be produced with key strategies on solutions regarding  information solicitation and contracting issues. Developers and business analysts will work with key stakeholders on the design, production, and verification of the Aquatic Dashboard software. 
## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept
The preliminary deployment will be done with a Beta Test of the user software in the userâ€™s environment to assess usability, functionality, security, and reliability of the software. 
## 6.3 Preliminary support concept
Preliminary support will be done during the Beta testing phase of the software development. Support will be provided via methods which include but is not limited to phones calls, text messages, emails, and support tickets.  Initial release of the software will include a user manual to provide training support to users. 
## 6.4 Preliminary retirement concept
Preliminary retirement of the system will involve replacing the software from production with a newer version or removal of the software completely. 
# 7. Project Constraints
Constraints with completion of the software may include government restriction with data acquisition, procedures, and policies.
